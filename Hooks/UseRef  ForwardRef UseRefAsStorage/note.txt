* Note: Do not use DOM in React. Because React controlls the DOM.
* But we have to work DOM related work in React. to controll DOM we use useEffect() nad useRef().

* useRef() : it refers to create a reference for html tag 
             to interact with the DOM or store values without causing re-renders.

* forwardRef() : it refers to send reference of html tags from Parent to Child Component

* useRef as Storage: after making variable of useRef(). you can make storage variable by "refVariable.current"
