* Hooks are optional and classes won't be remove from react

* Hooks can't be use in Class component

* It provides a more direct API to the react Concepts

* Always use Hooks in function and Top level in Function


Differences: 
useContext(): Prevents props drilling in Multiple Components

useEffect(): Prevents running side effects on every render by allowing you to specify dependencies that control when the effect should run.
It helps like lifeCycle in Class Component.

useMemo(): Prevents recalculating expensive computations on every render by memoizing the result and only recalculating when dependencies change.

useCallback(): Prevents recreating functions on every render by memoizing the function and only recreating it when dependencies change.
