* We know 
	** Render JSX Code
	** React Manage State and Props
	** Reacts to Events / Inputs
	** Evaluating state / props change and re-render

  Side Effect by using useEffect
	** Fetching Data from any API
	** Update Documents like tab's title or DOM
	** setting any subcripsions and timers

* side effects in class component are
	** componentDidMount(), ** componentWillUnMount()
	** componentDidUpdate()

* problems side effect in class component are
	** Repeating Code
	** Unorganized
    # Use useEffect Hook to prevent problems

* advantage 
	** help us perform side effects in function component
	** solve all problems of lifeCycle methods in class component
	** replace componentDidMount()
	 ** componentWillUNmount()
	 ** componentDidUpdate()
