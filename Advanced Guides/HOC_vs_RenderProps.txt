* Use Render Props when you need to customize how a component renders something.
* Use HOC when you want to reuse logic across multiple components.

* Render Props and HOCs (Higher-Order Components) can sometimes 
lead to overly complex or less readable code, 
especially if they are deeply nested or overused. 
Modern React encourages the use of hooks (like useState, useEffect, useContext) 
as a cleaner and more manageable alternative for reusing logic across components.
