HOC and Render Props prevent for reuses same logic of different component.
But those can't prevent props drill . 
props drill means that you assign props from ComponentA, ComponentA passed props to ComponentB,
ComponentB passed props to ComponentC, ComponentC passed props to ComponentD. 

but we need to passed ComponentA to CompnentB. which is unnecessary or passing props 
thorough ComponentC and ComponentD. which HOC and RENDER PROPS can't prevent it.


BUT USECONTEXT of Hook method can prevent PROPS DRILLING
